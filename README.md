About OOP in Python
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behaviors. In Python, OOP helps create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Itâ€™s particularly useful for large-scale projects where code organization and scalability are critical.
In Python, everything is an object (e.g., strings, lists, integers), making OOP a natural fit. You define classes as blueprints for objects, which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.
OOP Concepts Covered
This repository demonstrates the following core OOP principles:

Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances) with attributes and methods.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class, often using private attributes (e.g., __attribute) to protect data.
Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
Polymorphism: Enabling different classes to share the same method name with different implementations (e.g., method overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary features.
